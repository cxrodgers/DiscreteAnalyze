This module contains methods for analyzing discrete events in time,
such as action potentials or trials.

PointProc contains methods to smooth these events into analog signals
over various time scales.

EventSync contains methods to synchronize the clocks of two systems
recording the same events. I paid special attention to the case in which
an unknown number of events have been dropped from both event trains,
and in which the duration of the data (~1hr) is many orders of magnitude
larger than the timescale on which the events match up (~100ms).
